Snake Game using Python:
For beginners in Python and those seeking to create something simpler in their field can test this program. The module called Turtle was specifically designed to be used for beginners to play with and submit a program of the project. This project is written using Python 3.0.

A game that is based on Python with these modules:
1. Turtle: This is an installed Python library that allows users to draw patterns and images by providing the user with a virtual canvas.
2. Time: It is used in order to calculate the number of seconds since the date of the event.
3. Random: This is a function utilized to create random numbers in Python through the use of the random module.

Working:
1. The key that controls the snake's movement is When we click on the terms commonly used in gaming, such as "w" for upwards, "s" for downwards, "a" towards left, and "v" towards right, we will be able to control the snake's movement around the screen.
2. The snake's body will expand after eating the fruits.
3. Examining the snake's head for collides with body or side of the screen, the game will automatically restart immediately following the collision.
4. A new design and shape of this fruit are revealed each time the window is opened.

To run this .py file use vscode and run it in the terminal.
